# GrapplingHook
A grappling hook mechanic for Level Design

## What do we want to do with the hook? 

1. Pull objects closer to you
2. Shoot the hook to pull yourself to location (fast motion)
3. Swing on hook :eyes: (comebine with number two) 
4. Fishing/dredge up items by dropping the hook
5. Drag items (combine with number one)
6. HIT PEOPLE (or things) WITH IT (respectfully)
7. Rappel down? (slow motion - same hook points you can use to go up?)
