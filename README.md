# GrapplingHook
A grappling hook mechanic for Level Design

## What do we want to do with the hook? 

[these have been reoganized hence the numbering]

1. Pull objects closer to you - Alessia 
5. Drag items (combine with number one) - Alessia

2. Shoot the hook to pull yourself to location (fast motion) - Beau


4. Fishing/dredge up items by dropping the hook - Jude
6. HIT PEOPLE (or things) WITH IT (respectfully) - Jude



3. Swing on hook :eyes: (comebine with number two) [hard - physics]
7. Rappel down? (slow motion - same hook points you can use to go up?) [less hard but...not as needed]
